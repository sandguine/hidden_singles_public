1	5ae540	8	Correct	my strategy is very simple , add these numbers by the given number outside of the box if it is 15 i choose lowest number if its 19 or above i choose higher number , mostly i choose randomly
2	9c798b	1	Incorrect	Whatever third of the puzzle contained two non-blue numbers, I used those two numbers as a choice. Whichever would fit in a blue square exclusively was right.
3	db5261	6	Correct	I located the larger square with two numbers in it (6 and 1) that also contained  three small blue squares. This told me the green square would have a 6 or 1. I then checked to see if 6 could fit in one of the two remaining blue squares. Since there was already a 6 in each row I knew 6 had to be the solution for the green square.
4	d56384	3	Correct	Since I'm still not very knowledgeable about Sudoku, I just looked at which number was farthest away from the empty box and chose it.
5	38a153	1	Incorrect	"I went through a process of elimination by checking which numbers were already included in each square, since you can't duplicate numbers. 

But to be honest, I'm not sure if the 1 should go in the 1st, 3rd, or 4th blue box, Or if the 4 is in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. Sadly, these puzzles have made me feel not very bright!"
6	6c82a8	7	Correct	saw which number couldn't be elsewhere in the highlighted column
7	00d893	9	Correct	"As a beginner to Sudoku, it was tempting to start solving the puzzle by looking at the bright-colored green box, first. However, over time, I realized that I could win faster by just looking at the other boxes first. Therefore, I began the puzzle by first ignoring the bright-colored green box. First, I decided to start with the blue box on the far left. I asked myself - ""Can the number 9 go in this box?"" The answer was automatically ""no,"" because there was already a number 9 in the row/column/box. Then, I asked myself the same question, for the following blue boxes. And if the answer was ""no"" for each of the empty blue boxes, then I automatically knew that the only place left for the number 9, was the bright green box. This method was quicker for me, because I didn't even have to pay attention to the other number. However, if the answer to the question ""Can a nine fit in this blue box?"" had ever been ""Yes,"" then I would have come to the conclusion that 9 was not the answer."
8	5b8bc0	5	Correct	I eliminated the five and one from the final three boxes because they were already filled in the other two boxes of the 3x3 box so they cannot be shared. I then looked at columns that had five and one, and two columns had 5 and one column had one. The two columns couldn't have five twice, so I only remained with one possibility, that's why I placed the number in the box with certainty.
9	832f1f	6	Correct	Looking at the most shown numbers  given and comparing to the other numbers given, you can figure out the correct number that is missing.
10	9b3e67	4	Incorrect	I am still struggling how to do this. I looked to see if there was another 4 & 8, and seemed that 4 may be the answer. Apparently not. :(
11	bbcd05	3	Correct	I just calculating the values in the first row and accordingly I have selected this
12	3121c2	1	Incorrect	I looked at each row and column that already had 1 and 8 and formulated an educated guess that it might be 1.
13	8a94cf	8	Correct	I look at the possible solution numbers.  Next I look at each empty cell and ask myself if a possible solution number fits into the empty cell as the correct answer I am looking for.
14	92b882	1	Correct	Looked at the blue line. See 1 in middle right box keeping it safe. Only 1 spot in middle box. 2 spots in middle left box are blocked by 1s coming from upper left and bottom left, therefore I rule that middle box is a 1.
15	6161cc	6	Incorrect	I believe the number that comes first between 6 and 3 on the first 3 columns is the appropriate number to be inserted in the green space.
16	4bc78a	4	Correct	I used process of elimination. I eliminated numbers 1, 8, and 5 because those numbers are on the same row. I eliminated the number 9 because there was a 9 in the second box. That left me with the number 4.
17	5c33ce	5	Correct	So i find the square that had the 7 and 5 already in it I know since that has a 7 and 5 that I can eliminate those 3 blue squares. Then I go to the green square and find which blue square that can't be a 7 or 5 and then i find the blue square that can't be a 5 but can be a 7 so then I know since that blue square would be a 7 our green square would be the 5
18	9c081e	8	Correct	identified numbers in certain boxes relative to the green box.
19	f0467b	7	Correct	I mostly guessed. I'm still learning how to play this game.
20	dc66bc	6	Correct	I used the boxes in the blue row to determine which digits are missing. Then i looked for possible missing numbers that would be placed in the box.
